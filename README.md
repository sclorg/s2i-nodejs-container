NodeJS for OpenShift - Docker images
========================================

This repository contains the sources and
[Dockerfiles](https://github.com/openshift/sti-nodejs/tree/master/0.10)
of the base images for deploying various versions of NodeJS applications as reproducible Docker
images. The resulting images can be run either by [Docker](http://docker.io)
or using [STI](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image). 
User can choose between RHEL7 and CentOS7 base image.


Versions
---------------
The versions we currently support in this repository are:
* **nodejs-0.10**


Installation
---------------
To build NodeJS image, choose between CentOS7 or RHEL7 base image:
*  **RHEL7 base image**
    This image is not available as trusted build in [Docker Index](https://index.docker.io).

    To build a rhel-based nodejs-0.10 image, you need to run the build on properly subscribed RHEL machine.

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/openshift/sti-nodejs.git
    $ cd sti-nodejs
    $ make build TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=0.10
    ```

*  **CentOS7 base image**
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/openshift/sti-nodejs.git
    $ cd sti-nodejs
    $ make build VERSION=0.10
    ```

**Notice: By omitting the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action will be performed on all the supported versions of NodeJS. Since we are now supporting only version `0.10`, you can omit this parameter**


Usage
---------------------
Building simple [nodejs-echo-app](https://github.com/ryanj/node-echo) NodeJS application, using standalone [STI](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) and running the resulting image by [Docker](http://docker.io):

*  **For RHEL7 base image**
    ```
    $ sti build https://github.com/ryanj/node-echo.git nodejs-0.10-rhel7 nodejs-echo-app
    $ docker run -p 3000:3000 nodejs-echo-app
    ```

*  **For CentOS7 base image**
    ```
    $ sti build https://github.com/ryanj/node-echo.git nodejs-0.10-centos7 nodejs-echo-app
    $ docker run -p 3000:3000 nodejs-echo-app
    ```

**Accessing the application:**
```
$ curl 127.0.0.1:3000
```


Test
---------------------
This repository also provides STI test framework, which launches test to check functionality
of a simple nodejs application built on top of sti-nodejs image.

User can choose between testing of nodejs test application based on RHEL7 and CentOS7 image.

*  **RHEL7 base image**

    This image is not available as trusted build in [Docker Index](https://index.docker.io).

    To test a rhel7-based nodejs-0.10 image, you need to run the test on properly subscribed RHEL machine.

    ```
    $ cd sti-nodejs
    $ make test TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=0.10
    ```

*  **CentOS7 base image**

    ```
    $ cd sti-nodejs
    $ make test VERSION=0.10
    ```

**Notice: By omitting the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action will be performed on all the supported versions of NodeJS. Since we are now supporting only version `0.10` you can omit this parameter**


Repository organization
------------------------
* **`<nodejs-version>`**

    * **Dockerfile**

        CentOS7 based Dockerfile.

    * **Dockerfile.rhel7**

        RHEL7 based Dockerfile. In order to perform build or test actions on this Dockerfile you need to run the action on properly subscribed RHEL machine.

    * **`.sti/bin/`**

        This folder contains scripts that are run by [STI](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image):

        *   **assemble**

            Is used to install the sources into location from where the application
            will be run and prepare the application for deployment (eg. installing
            modules using npm, etc..)

        *   **run**

            This script is responsible for running the application, by using the
            application web server.

        *   **save-artifacts**

            In order to do an *incremental build* (iow. re-use the build artifacts
            from an already built image in a new image), this script is responsible for
            archiving those. In this image, this script will archive all dependent modules.

    * **`nodejs/`**

        This folder contains file with commonly used modules.

    * **`test/`**

        This folder is containing STI test framework with simple node.js echo server.

        * **`test-app/`**

            Simple node.js echo server for used for testing purposes in the STI test framework.

        * **run**

            Script that runs the STI test framework.

* **`hack/`**
    
    Folder contains scripts which are responsible for build and test actions performed by the `Makefile`.


Environment variables
---------------------

*  **APP_ROOT** (default: '.')

    This variable specifies a relative location to your application inside the
    application GIT repository. In case your application is located in a
    sub-folder, you can set this variable to a *./myapplication*.

*  **STI_SCRIPTS_URL** (default: '[.sti/bin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/sti-nodejs/master/0.10/.sti/bin)')

    This variable specifies the location of directory, where *assemble*, *run* and
    *save-artifacts* scripts are downloaded/copied from. By default the scripts
    in this repository will be used, but users can provide an alternative
    location and run their own scripts.
